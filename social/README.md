At CAMEL-AI, we have a simple yet profound belief:

If AGI exists, it must be a multi-agent system. Our Mission is clear: [`Finding the Scaling Laws of Agents`](https://www.camel-ai.org/blogs/mission-at-camel-ai-org-finding-the-scaling-laws-of-agents). 

Intelligence emerges from diversity, not a single perfect principle.
Multi-agent systems naturally follow "divide and conquer" approaches,
breaking down complex problems across multiple specialized agents.

<br>

Since 2023, we've been building the first multi-agent framework CAMEL

We're focused on **5 dimensions** of agent scaling laws:

- **Number of Agents** - through our [`üê´ CAMEL framework`](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel) from role-playing to workforce.**

- **Synthetic Data** - our [`üêâ Loong Project`](https://github.com/camel-ai/loong) generates verifiable data through agents.

- **Environments** - with [`ü¶ÄÔ∏è CRAB`](https://github.com/camel-ai/crab) and [`ü¶â OWL`](https://github.com/camel-ai/owl) for computer operations, and [`üèùÔ∏è OASIS`](https://github.com/camel-ai/oasis) for simulating millions of social agents.

- **Memory** - our GraphRAG helps agents access and share structured memories.

- **Evolution** - building reinforcement learning `üåä Environments` for continuous improvement.

<br>

The journey from single-point tasks to global organizational intelligence, What's missing is scalable environments and reward functions, something the community can help build together.

The Scaling Environments to help agents evolve, create memories, and generalize across diverse tasks will include

`tools`, `domain-specific verifiers`, `devices operators`, `large-scale social simulators`, `reinforcement learning`, `data-driven pipeline` and so on..

We're creating the infrastructure from frameworks to applications.
Although we're far from our ultimate goal, the journey excites us.

We believe in multi-agent systems as the future of AI.

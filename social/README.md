At CAMEL-AI, we have a simple yet profound belief:

If AGI exists, it must be a multi-agent system. **Our Mission** is clear: [`Finding the Scaling Laws of Agents`](https://www.camel-ai.org/blogs/mission-at-camel-ai-org-finding-the-scaling-laws-of-agents). Intelligence emerges from diversity, not a single perfect principle. Multi-agent systems naturally follow "divide and conquer" approaches, breaking down complex problems across multiple specialized agents. Since 2023, we've been building the first multi-agent framework CAMEL

**‚ú® We're focused on 3 dimensions of agent scaling laws:**

- **Number of Agents</br>**
   through our [`üê´ CAMEL framework`](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel)  to [`üèùÔ∏è OASIS`](https://github.com/camel-ai/oasis) for simulating millions of social agents
 
- **Environments</br>**
   with [`ü¶ÄÔ∏è CRAB`](https://github.com/camel-ai/crab) and [`ü¶â OWL`](https://github.com/camel-ai/owl) for computer operations; `üåä SEA` building reinforcement learning environment  for continuous  improvement.

- **Evolution</br>**
   [`CAMEL's RAG & GraphRAG`] helps agents access and learn from external knowledge base;  our [`üêâ Loong Project`](https://github.com/camel-ai/loong) generates verifiable syntheticdata through agents

We're creating the infrastructure from frameworks to applications. Although we're far from our ultimate goal, the journey excites us. We believe in multi-agent systems as the future of AI.
